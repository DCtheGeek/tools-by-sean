# Camp clothes rack

I built this rack to take to the 24th World Scout Jamboree at the Summit Bechtel Reserve. It uses
12-feet of 1/2-inch PVC pipe. I bought two 10-foot lengths, so I had 8-feet left over. Home
Depot sells a 2-foot length for $1.31. Not much savings over buying a 10-foot section.

1. Assemble the base using the four 12-inch tubes with 45-degree elbows. The elbows are joined by a
   2-inch tube.

1. Assemble the uprights by joining two 18-inch tubes using the couplers.

   Center the hanging organizer for stability. There is room to hang other clothes on either side.

### Notes

- I highly recommend purchasing the PVC tube cutters if you don't have them. The cuts are super
  clean and easy.
- At Home Depot, the 3-way side-outlet connectors came with one threaded coupling and two slip-fit
  couplings. So I had to buy the threaded adapter to go on top.
- I chose to use couplers and two 18-inch tubes for the uprights. This is more rigid than using
  single 36-inch tubes. And it breaks down smaller to pack in my duffle bag.
- I used colored markers to mark the ends of the tubes and the couplers they fit into. This makes it
  easier to reassemble later.
- I bought the closet organizer at Fred Meyer (similar to Target). It is 10-inches square and
  36-inches tall (when hanging).

## Packing

The whole kit weighs 3lbs-6oz. I used bungie cords to wrap the poles and organize the couplers.
