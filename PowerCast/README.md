# PowerCast

A PowerShell Podcast client

This is my first Git project. I am using this as an opportunity to learn ADO.NET, use SQLite, and expand my skills in PowerShell.

I am starting by building a framework of functions to manage the database, consume RSS/Atom podcast feeds, and download media enclosures published in the feed. Eventually I will create a UI for this. The goal is to have a podcast client that works the way I want it to.
