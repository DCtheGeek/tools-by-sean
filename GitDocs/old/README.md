# README

I created these articles to document what I have learned about using Git, GitHub, and our authoring
tools and processes. Some of the guidance I provide differs from guidance published in our official
contributors guide. My suggestions should be compatible with the contributors guide.

1. [Understanding Git and GitHub](Understanding%20Git%20Workflow.md)
2. [Setting up your tools](Setting%20up%20tools.md)
3. [Configuring Git](Configuring%20Git.md)
4. [Common Git Tasks](Common%20Git%20tasks.md)

I welcome feedback and suggestions.
